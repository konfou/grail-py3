    The current goal of this cache is to provide a safe mechanism for
    sharing image objects between multiple Viewer windows.

    In future release, the image cache should actually delete objects
    from the cache (what a concept!). Currently, a Grail process will
    grow without bound as new images are displayed. This is a bug.
